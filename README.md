Blocks copying utility for EV3 Classroom and Spike

This web-based utility allows you to copy Blocks between different EV3 Classroom (.lmsp) and Spike (.llsp) files.
To use, visit https://quirkycort.github.io/ev3copy/

Note that while the utility won't stop you from copying Spike blocks into EV3 Classroom programs (...and vice versa), the downloaded lmsp/llsp file will NOT work.
